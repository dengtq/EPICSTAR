Si: example for non-polar semiconductor silicon

GaAs: example for polar semiconductor gallium arsenide

# Notes

1. Si.benchmark.tar.gz and GaAs.benchmark.tar.gz contains example output for comparison.

2. The parameters are designed for fast test and demonstration only, and are not expected to achieve meaningful results.
   Real calculations must be carried out after proper convergence test.
